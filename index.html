    <p><b>Reconceptualising Maths and Science Teacher Education Programs (ReMSTEP)</b>, responds to the need for improved competence and confidence in the teaching of science and maths, as a pre-service focus, across the Australian Curriculum.</p>
    <p>Funded by the Office for Learning and Teaching, ReMSTEP is a three year collaborative project led by the University of Melbourne in association with Deakin, La Trobe and Monash universities.</p>
    <p>ReMSTEPs project activities are centred around developing new teacher education practices that align contemporary approaches to STEM with engaging teaching and learning.</p>

        <h2>30%</h2>
        <p>of 15-year-old Australian students were enrolled in schools whose leaders reported that a lack of qualified mathematics teachers was hindering instruction, the firgure was 24% for science <sup>1</sup></p>
    </aside>
    <p>Core to ReMSTEP initiatives is the introduction of new science and maths course electives and / or student learning pathways. Equally important is the building of collaborative relationships across faculties, universities and specialist science and maths centres.</p>
    <p>These partnerships will drive major improvements in the quality of mathematics and science learning and teaching by creating programs where undergraduate STEM students and pre-service teachers work collaboratively across faculties and specialist centres to create new materials, units of study and expertise in inquiry-based classroom practices.</p>
    <p>ReMSTEP is funded by the Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) over three years (2014-2016) and is part of the wider OLT Program: <em>Enhancing the Training of Mathematics and Science Teachers</em> (ETMST).</p>
